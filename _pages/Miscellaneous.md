### Random stuff
I spent my childhood in the coastal city of [Mangalore, now Mangaluru)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangalore) in the state of Karnataka on the western coast of India.
Mangalore has several monikers including **the cradle of indian banking**, **the ice-cream capital of India** etc.

Mangalore is extremely diverse in terms of religion, culture, and languages. This has helped me to become fluent in several languages and acquire a flare for learning new languages. 
I can fluently speak, read and write in English, Kannada, and Hindi. I can read and write Sanskrit. I can also speak fluent Konkani and Tulu (they do not have an official script), as well as comprehend Tamil (thanks to colleagues at IIT Madras) and Telugu (Thanks to [Varsha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varsha-pendyala)!) to a reasonable extent. 
My native language (the one I speak with family) is [Konkani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konkani_language). Of the many Konkani dialects, I speak [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaud_Saraswat_Brahmin).

### People who inspire me
My great-uncle, Prof. N.R. Kamath was a pioneering Chemical Engineer. He was the founding deputy director and first chair of the chemical engineering department at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-Bombay). He is also credited to have started the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) dubbed as one of the toughest engineering entrance examinations in the world. I have always looked up to his life and career for inspiration.
His students have established a named professorship at IIT-Bombay in his memory. A YouTube video about his life can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qMXQki9hqU) and some more material is [here](https://fundamatics.net/article/n-r-kamath-an-iconoclast-and-an-educator/)

Co-incidentally, several people with origins from Mangalore have significantly contributed to electrical engineering (specifically electrical power engineering). 
This includes [Late Prof. Mangalore Anant Pai (M.A. Pai)](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/mapai) at IIT Kanpur / the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and [Prof. Jayant Baliga](https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/people/bjbaliga/) at NC State University (Inventor of the IGBT). They have never ceased to inspire me. 

### Hobbies
My hobbies include philately, numismatics, hobby robotics, cooking, and Indian classical music.

I started collecting stamps and coins at the age of 6, when Liv, a Norwegian friend of my grandparents', gifted me her collection of stamps with M.K. Gandhi on them from different countries across the world.
As of Feb 2025, I have approximately ten thousand stamps and approximately seven thousand coins + currency bills from over 40 countries.

I am deeply interested in the Indian classical music. _Hindustani / North Indian_ and _Carnatic / South Indian_ are two variants of the Indian classical music. I was introduced to music at a very young age by my mother who is a trained Hindustani-violinist with several concerts to her credit.
I started off training in Carnatic classical music at the age of 7 and continued until the age of 12.To this day, I listen to Indian classical music (Hindustani and Carnatic) when I work - I find it really soothing. My favorite raga is the *Hamsadhwani*, which incidentally comes from the Carnatic variant.
