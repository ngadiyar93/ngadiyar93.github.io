## Research Vision
As the world accelerates toward an electrified and sustainable future, the demand for next-generation electro-mechanical systems has never been greater. 
These systems must be energy-efficient, precise, compact/power-dense, and highly reliable across a wide range of applications and power levels.

Achieving these ambitious targets requires addressing several complex and often competing objectives: eliminating reliance on critical rare-earth materials, ensuring sustainable material choices, and enabling circular supply chains through critical material recovery and recycling. 
These challenges cannot be solved in isolation and demand a **holistic, inter-disciplinary approach**.

My research is rooted in this systems-level thinking. I work at the intersection of *electric machines, power electronics, and advanced physics-based control*, with a deep focus on multi-physics interactions and system-level integration and optimization.

I push the boundaries beyond today's state-of-the art by *unlocking additional degrees of freedom* in electric machines (using spatial harmonics), developing new multi-level power electronic drives, integrating cutting-edge methods from **multi-physics modeling, multi-objective and topology optimization, AI/machine learning, model-based systems engineering, and materials science**. 
This approach allows me to radically enhance the performance, efficiency, and sustainability of electro-mechanical systems to achieve improvements by orders of magnitude over current state-of-the-art solutions.

## Broader Impacts
The outcomes of my research have far-reaching implications across sectors from **electric transportation, energy generation systems, mechatronic systems, aerospace, and robotics, to industrial drives and next-generation manufacturing**. 
By minimizing dependence on rare-earth materials and enabling efficient design and recycling practices, my work directly contributes to **reducing environmental impact, improving energy equity, and securing critical material supply chains**.

Beyond technical advancement, my research supports a sustainable, resilient, and circular economy, and helps shape a future where high-performance electro-mechanical systems are not only more capable, but also more accessible and environmentally responsible.
