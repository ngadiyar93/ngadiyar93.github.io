Hi there, I am Nishanth Gadiyar, a member of the R&D staff at the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/fnu-nishanth). I also hold the Alvin M. Weinberg [distinguished staff fellowship](https://www.ornl.gov/careers/distinguished-fellowships).

Prior to joining ORNL in October 2024, I worked as a Research Engineer at General Electric (GE) Research, a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a research intern at the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories.
I received my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was advised by [Prof. Eric Severson](https://elev.umn.edu/) and worked with the world-renowned [Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC)](https://wempec.wisc.edu/). A redacted version of my Ph.D. dissertation can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380099454_An_Investigation_of_Power_Dense_Axial_Flux_Electric_Machines_to_Electrify_Off-Highway_Vehicles_Chapters_1_-_7).

My current research focuses on developing **high-performance and sustainable electro-mechanical systems** for energy conversion and motion control. I work at the intersection of *electric machines, power-electronics,* and *physics-based control*
to create devices and systems that can efficiently and sustainably convert energy between electrical (e.g., currents, voltages) and mechanical forms (i.e., position, speed, torque, force). 

Thanks to the multi-disciplinary nature of my research, I work closely with experts in the areas of mechanical engineering, physics, chemistry, materials science, high throughput computing, and AI / machine learning.
Areas of application for my research include, *electrified transportation and off-highway vehicles*, *aerospace actuation and propulsion*, *precision mechatronics and robotic actuators*, *turbomachinery*, *grid-scale energy storage*, and *wind / renewable energy*.

**Note:** Before changing my name in March 2025, I had only one name "Nishanth" and was mostly known as FNU Nishanth. [Read more about "FNU" here](https://viveksinghblog.medium.com/change-my-name-remove-fnu-9bb5687e44c).
