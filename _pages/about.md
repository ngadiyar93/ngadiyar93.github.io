Hi there, I am Nishanth Gadiyar, a member of the R&D staff at the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/fnu-nishanth). I also hold the Alvin M. Weinberg [distinguished staff fellowship](https://www.ornl.gov/careers/distinguished-fellowships). 
Until deciding to use my parents last name in Feb 2025, I used the name FNU Nishanth since I had just one name (FNU -- First Name Unknown).

Before joining ORNL in October 2024, I worked as a Research Engineer at GE Research, a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a research intern at the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories. 

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was advised by [Prof. Eric Severson](https://elev.umn.edu/) and worked with the world-renowned [Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC)](https://wempec.wisc.edu/). A redacted version of my Ph.D. dissertation can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380099454_An_Investigation_of_Power_Dense_Axial_Flux_Electric_Machines_to_Electrify_Off-Highway_Vehicles_Chapters_1_-_7).

My current research focuses on developing **high-performance and sustainable electro-mechanical energy conversion and motion control systems**, i.e, I work at the intersection of *electric machines, power-electronics,* and *physics-based control*
to investigate and develop devices and systems that can efficiently and sustainably inter-convert energy between electrical (e.g., currents, voltages) and mechanical forms (i.e., position, speed, torque, force).

Nearly all my projects involve inter-disciplinary collaborations, and I work closely with experts in the areas of mechanical engineering, thermal science, materials science, high throughput computing, and AI / machine learning.
Areas of application for my research include, *electrified transportation and off-highway vehicles*, *aerospace actuation and propulsion*, *precision mechatronics and robotic actuators*, *turbomachinery*, *grid-scale energy storage*, and *wind / renewable energy*.

In addition to solving complex problems through research, I am deeply interested and committed to engineering education and outreach. STEM outreach is an important topic for me, especially in the context of diversity, equity, and inclusion. During my PhD, I engaged in STEM outreach through my research group and the Wisconsin 4-H program. I am eager to continue these efforts to help address systemic barriers and promote equitable access to STEM fields.
