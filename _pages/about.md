Hi there, I am Nishanth, a member of the research and development staff at the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/fnu-nishanth). I also hold the Alvin M. Weinberg [distinguished staff fellowship](https://www.ornl.gov/careers/distinguished-fellowships). 

Prior to joining ORNL in October 2024, I worked as a Research Engineer at GE Research for about a year and a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I worked with the world-renowned [Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC)](https://wempec.wisc.edu/), and was advised by [Prof. Eric Severson](https://elev.umn.edu/). A redacted version of my dissertaion can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380099454_An_Investigation_of_Power_Dense_Axial_Flux_Electric_Machines_to_Electrify_Off-Highway_Vehicles_Chapters_1_-_7)

My current research focuses on developing **high-performance and sustainable** electro-mechanical energy conversion and motion control systems. My work is at the intersection of the traditional areas of **electric machines, power-electronics and motion-control**. I frequently collaborate with mechanical engineers, materials scientists, and AI / machine learning experts.

My research finds applications in **precise motion control equipment** for semiconductor fabs, **electric vehicles and industrial equipment**, and **aerospace propulsion and wind energy** generation.

Apart from research, I am deeply interested and committed to engineering education and outreach. STEM outreach is an important topic for me, especially in the context of diversity, equity, and inclusion. During my PhD, I engaged in STEM outreach through my research group and the Wisconsin 4-H program. I am eager to continue these efforts to help address systemic barriers and promote equitable access to STEM fields. ORNL's Office of Research Education has put together a flyer on my STEM journey, which can be accessed [here](https://www.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/2025-01/DSFatORNLProfile_Nishanth.pdf)
