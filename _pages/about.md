Hi there, I am Nishanth Gadiyar, a member of the R&D staff at the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/fnu-nishanth). I also hold the Alvin M. Weinberg [distinguished staff fellowship](https://www.ornl.gov/careers/distinguished-fellowships).

Prior to joining ORNL in October 2024, I worked as a Research Engineer at General Electric (GE) Research (2023-2024), a research assistant, teaching assistant, and research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2018-2023), and a research intern at the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (2021).

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I worked with [Prof. Eric Severson](https://elev.umn.edu/) at the world-renowned [Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC)](https://wempec.wisc.edu/).

My research focuses on developing **high-performance and sustainable electro-mechanical systems** for energy conversion and motion control. I work at the intersection of *electric machines, power-electronics,* and *physics-based control*
to create devices and systems that can efficiently and sustainably convert energy between electrical (e.g., currents, voltages) and mechanical forms (i.e., position, speed, torque, force).

Thanks to the multi-disciplinary nature of my research, I often work closely with experts in the areas of mechanical engineering, chemistry, materials science, semiconductor physics, nuclear physics / neutron imaging, high throughput computing, and AI / machine learning.
A non-exhaustive list of applications for my research include, *electrified transportation and off-highway vehicles*, *aerospace actuation and propulsion*, *mechatronic systems and robotic actuators*, *turbomachinery*, *grid-scale energy storage*, and *wind / renewable energy*.

**Note:** Before changing my name in March 2025, I had only one name "Nishanth" and was mostly known as FNU Nishanth. [Read more about "FNU" here](https://viveksinghblog.medium.com/change-my-name-remove-fnu-9bb5687e44c).
