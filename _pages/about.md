Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Nishanth, an Alvin M. Weinberg distinguished staff fellow with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

Prior to joining ORNL, I worked as a Research Engineer at GE Research and a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I worked with the world renowned Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC)- one of the largest industry-academia consortium in the world. I was advised by [Prof. Eric Severson](https://elev.umn.edu/) and was part of a young and dynamic research group that works on cool, niche (and weird) electric machines and electro-mechanical systems.

My work at WEMPEC focused on the design, analysis, and optimization of electro-mechanical energy conversion systems, encompassing sub-domains of electric machines, power electronics, and control, with applications to off-highway vehicle electrification.
