Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Nishanth, a distinguished staff fellow with the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/fnu-nishanth) since October 2024. 

Prior to joining ORNL, I worked as a Research Engineer at GE Research for about a year and a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I worked with the world-renowned [Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC)](https://wempec.wisc.edu/). I was advised by [Prof. Eric Severson](https://elev.umn.edu/) and was part of a young and dynamic research group that works on cool, niche (and weird) electric machines and electro-mechanical systems. My Ph.D. research focused on developing a new integrated electro-hydraulic machine for electrified off-highway vehicles, a new technique to unlock additional degrees of freedom in multi-phase electric machines, and demonstrating the use of additive manufacturing techniques to unlock new high-performance electric machine geometries.

My research interest is in developing **sustainable electro-mechanical energy conversion and motion control systems**. My work encompasses the traditional areas of **electric machines, power-electronics and motion-control**. I frequently collaborate with researchers in mechanical engineering, materials science, AI / machine learning, high-throughput computing, and topology optimization. 

My work can be applied to a range of scenarios from small and **precise motion control equipment for semiconductor fabs**, to medium size **propulsion drives for electric cars, trucks, and off-highway vehicles**, and all the way to **MW-level machines used in aerospace propulsion and wind energy** generation.
