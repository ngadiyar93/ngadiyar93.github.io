I have just one name Nishanth, which works fine in my birth country India, but causes issues in the western world where a first and a last name are expected.

My US Student Visa in 2018 renamed me as "FNU Nishanth" where FNU is the USCIS's abbreviation for First Name Unknown (The U.S. likes having a last name, hence this formatting).

Fast forward to 2025, my employer re-christened me as Nishanth NLN -- they belive that's how people like me with a single name must be named. 

Tired with all the 3-letter abbreviations, I've decided to adopt my parents' last name and here I am, Nishanth Gadiyar on all social media and publications.

I've asked IEEE to update my publications, and I am working with the consulate and the county court to change my name officially. Eagerly looking forward to the day I "officially" become Nishanth Gadiyar!
