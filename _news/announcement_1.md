Nishanth will receive Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funding from ORNL under the Weinberg initiative for three years. 
This project will investigate the potential of multi-harmonic technology (controlling multiple spatial harmonic magnetic fields) to enhance the performance of rare-earth free electric machines.

This project applies the [multi-harmonic winding analysis and design theory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10313586) developed in Nishanth's Ph.D. research.
