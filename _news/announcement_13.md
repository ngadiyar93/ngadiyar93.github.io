I am co-organizing a special session on "Novel Materials and Additive Manufacturing Techniques to Realize the Next-Gen Electric Machines" at the [2025 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference](https://www.iemdc.org/) in Houston, TX, on May 19th.
In this session, five distinguished experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories will present their perspectives on how advances in materials science and manufacturing can enable the next-gen electric machine designs.
