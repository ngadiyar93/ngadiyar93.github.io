Nishanth's paper "Electric Machine Torque Density Enhancement using Spatial Harmonics" is accepted for oral presentation at the 2025 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Expo (ECCE) in Philadelphia, PA. This paper is the first work to experimentally demonstrate
torque enhancement in axial flux PM machines using spatial harmonics.
