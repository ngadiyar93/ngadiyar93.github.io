Our Work [Development of Solid Synchronous Reluctance Rotors With Multi-Material Additive Manufacturing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10816056) has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, March-April 2025 issue. This is **the first publication** of a SynR rotor prototype constructed via MMAM.

**Abstract:** Synchronous reluctance (SynR) machines are promising rare-earth material-free alternatives to permanent magnet machines. However, structural challenges limit their operating speed and power density. This paper proposes and investigates multi-material additive manufacturing (MMAM) as a key-enabler to realize power-dense and high-speed SynR machines. It does so by proposing designs that guide magnetic flux through solid rotors realized by selective placement of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. To explore this concept, first, material samples are additively manufactured and experimentally characterized to assess the structural and magnetic properties that can be expected for the proposed rotors. Second, the design space of each rotor type is explored using these measured properties within finite element analysis. The results reveal that MMAM can enable fabrication of SynR motors with power density levels that are at the leading edge of all conventional electric machine topologies. It is shown that tip speeds in excess of 300 m/s can be achieved, resulting in 3-4x improvement in power density over conventional SynR motors. A solid SynR rotor is printed in an experimental MMAM laser powder bed fusion system. The rotor is paired with an existing stator to create a functional SynR motor with a saliency ratio of 2.59 and torque rating of 4.15 Nm.
